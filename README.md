## Instructions to run on local machine- 

1. simply download the files, and view the index.html on local host (can use LiveServer if using VScode)

PS i commited a new app.js at around 12.25 am, since i forgot to update the file before the form submission. you can check my previous app.js from commit history-
the site is exactly the same, i just added a 'view forkers' button after that which i forgot to commit. Kindly consider.
